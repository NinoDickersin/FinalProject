Final Project for Mr. Ks APCS Class

We are going to make a projectile launch game. The game will feature a launch device (cannon, ramp, slingshot, etc.), a lovable ferret (who will be the projectile), various items that can be purchased with in-game coins to assist the ferret in its launch, and powerups that can be grabbed during the ferret's flight. The player will be able to control the angle and power of the launch device, and purchase items that boosts the device's power, allowing the ferret to travel farther. The distance the ferret travels will be determined by its initial velocity and gravity. The player will also be able to purchase items that boost the ferret during flight, including a jetpack and a glider that allows the player to fall at varying speeds. Various powerups can be collected during the ferret's flight, including additional jetpack fuel, coins, and launch rockets. At the end of the flight, the player will acquire a number of coins depending on the ferret's airbore time, vertical, and horizontal max height. The game is complete once the ferret has reached a certain distance, and the player's score is determined by how many flights it took to reach that distance.
